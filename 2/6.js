// React - Allows us to write declarative viewws that "react" to changes in data
// Allows us to abstract complex problems into smaller components
// Allows us to write simple code that  is still peerformant

// Imperative vs Declarative
// - How vs What
// - html is declarative
// - React is declarative
// - React alows us to write what we want, and the library will take care of the DOM manipulation
