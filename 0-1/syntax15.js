//In browser there is
//window
//which is a global object
//any variable declared in the console for that webpage gets put onto global object 'widow'

//var y is exact same thing as window.y 
//but same can't be said about const because it is handled differenly by window of the browser

//window does not exist in node environment because it's not called as window, it's called as global
